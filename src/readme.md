# Experiment Design
In this experiment, there is always a target object in the scene. The target object has different "movement modes." There are two categories of movement modes. 
1. Interactive movement modes: The target object is moved based on the user's action. It could be eye movement, mouse movement, and so on.
2. Non-interactive movement modes: The target object is moved based on a pre-defined algorithm.

After a certain presentation duration, the movement modes change. This change could be accompanied by a change in appearance of the target object. The change should interleave with the two categories of movement modes. For example, the first mode is interactive, and the second mode is non-interactive. The third mode is interactive, and the fourth mode is non-interactive. 

After a fixed number of changes, the experiment ends.
